Simple SCADA Tank Report Script

I broke up your script into several functions that each do a job. GetXMLValues, PrepareDictionary, WriteToFile./n
Needs testing and error checking but should be easier to maintain than what you had./n
Did not modify any other functions except CheckValue to get easier values to deal with./n
Changed up the LogLevel implementation to make more sense.
